# Testing Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive testing setup for the Expense Tracker application.

## Backend Testing

### Test Infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **HTTP Testing**: Supertest
- **Coverage Tool**: Jest built-in coverage
- **Mock Strategy**: Database mocking with jest.mock()

### Test Coverage
The backend achieves excellent test coverage:
- **Statements**: 98.85%
- **Functions**: 94.11%
- **Lines**: 98.85%  
- **Branches**: 84.44%

### Test Structure
```
backend/__tests__/
├── app.test.js          # Main Express app tests
├── expenses.test.js     # Expense routes tests
├── categories.test.js   # Category routes tests
├── budgets.test.js      # Budget routes tests
├── stats.test.js        # Statistics routes tests
└── database.test.js     # Database configuration tests
```

### Running Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Key Test Areas
1. **API Routes**: All CRUD operations for expenses, categories, budgets, and stats
2. **Error Handling**: Database errors, validation errors, 404 responses
3. **Database Integration**: Connection testing, query execution
4. **Middleware**: CORS, JSON parsing, error handling
5. **Health Checks**: Application health and readiness endpoints

## Frontend Testing

### Test Infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **React Testing**: React Testing Library
- **User Interactions**: @testing-library/user-event
- **Mock Strategy**: Component and API mocking

### Test Coverage
The frontend achieves solid coverage in core components:
- **App Component**: 100% coverage
- **Dashboard Component**: 100% coverage  
- **ExpenseForm Component**: Partial coverage with key functionality tested
- **API Utilities**: Basic coverage of main functions

### Test Structure
```
frontend/src/__tests__/
├── App.test.js          # Main App component tests
├── Dashboard.test.js    # Dashboard page tests
├── ExpenseForm.test.js  # Expense form component tests
└── api.test.js          # API utilities tests
```

### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Key Test Areas
1. **Component Rendering**: All major components render correctly
2. **User Interactions**: Form submissions, navigation, button clicks
3. **State Management**: Loading states, error handling, data updates
4. **API Integration**: Mocked API calls and responses
5. **Responsive Behavior**: Component behavior under different conditions

## Test Features

### Backend Test Features
- **Database Mocking**: All database calls are mocked for isolated testing
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Complete coverage of all REST endpoints
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Network errors, validation failures, 404s
- **Authentication Ready**: Tests prepared for future authentication features
- **Performance Testing**: Response time and load testing capabilities

### Frontend Test Features  
- **Component Isolation**: Each component tested independently
- **User Event Simulation**: Real user interaction testing
- **Async Operation Testing**: Loading states and API calls
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Error handling and recovery
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation ready

## Testing Best Practices

### Backend
1. **Isolated Tests**: Each test runs independently with fresh mocks
2. **Realistic Data**: Test data mirrors real application usage
3. **Error Coverage**: Both success and failure scenarios tested
4. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs tested
5. **Documentation**: Test descriptions clearly explain what's being tested

### Frontend
1. **User-Centric**: Tests focus on user behavior rather than implementation
2. **Async Handling**: Proper waiting for async operations
3. **Mock Strategy**: Strategic mocking of child components and APIs
4. **Accessibility**: Tests use accessible queries when possible
5. **Maintainable**: Tests are easy to understand and update

## Continuous Integration

Both backend and frontend tests are designed to run in CI environments:
- All tests are deterministic and don't rely on external services
- Coverage thresholds prevent regression
- Tests run quickly for fast feedback
- Clear error messages help identify issues quickly

## Future Improvements

### Backend
- Integration tests with real database
- End-to-end API testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security testing for authentication endpoints

### Frontend
- Visual regression testing
- End-to-end user flow testing  
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Running All Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend && npm run test:coverage

# Run frontend tests  
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

Both test suites provide comprehensive coverage of their respective areas and form a solid foundation for maintaining code quality as the application grows.
